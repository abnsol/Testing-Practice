# Testing Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum where I learned how to write tests using **Jest** and applied techniques like **triangulation**. The project also involves configuring **Jest** to work with **ES6 modules** using **Babel**.

## Key Learnings

-   **Jest** for unit testing in JavaScript.
-   Testing techniques like **triangulation** to ensure robust test cases.
-   Configuring **Jest** with **Babel** to support ES6 modules (`import/export`).
